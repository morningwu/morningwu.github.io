			      <h1>Hello I'm Morning Wu</h1>
			      <p>I'm a digital marketer born and raised in HongKong.Spent few years in the marketing field, i find my passion are in building digital products, i've started my first project - Learn2win in 2012, there is where my journey of digital a digital product developer started. </p>

			      <p>I know nothing about programming at that time, and always get lose when I don't know how to communicate with developer, have no idea how to estimate the time needed to build a features and out of track on anticipating the cost.We build a pilot version in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYbMR85bZsE" target="_blank">youtube</a> and generated 220k organic view (Thanks to youtube :) ), but eventually I didn't sustain the growth and the project was failed. </p>

			      <p>After Learn2win I've started another project - ExamPilot and teach my to code (mainly php). The journey was fun but the project didn't go well at last.I've went back to marketing field afterward but i know what I'm passionate in is to build digital products. </p>

						<h1>Why I'm applying Founder and Coder?</h1>
						<p >I'm turning 30 this year(I'm born in 1987) and I think it's time to really dive into something I am passionate in(in stead of keep working in a 9-to-5 where i don't really enjoy :( .
