			      <h1>Hello I'm Morning Wu</h1>
			      <p>I'm born and raised in Hong Kong. I spent the last 8 years in the digital marketing field, and find what i really passionate in is to build somethings from scratch.I've started my first project web based project(or a startup in other word) - Learn2win in 2012,where my journey of building digital product started. </p>

			      <p>I know nothing about programming at that time, and always get lose while I have no idea how to communicate with developer effectively, lack of knowledge in estimating the time needed to build a features and out of track on anticipating the cost.We build a pilot version in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYbMR85bZsE" target="_blank">youtube</a> and generated 220k organic view (Thanks to youtube :) ), but eventually I didn't sustain the growth and the project was failed. </p>

			      <p>After that I've started another project - ExamPilot in early 2013. Learning from experience i do believe it's important to know some programing (at least i know how diffuclt is it when i want to build a new feature).So I teach myself to code with all the online resrouces i found online(I'm a early user of Codecademy, Treehouse and Udemy). The journey was fun but the project didn't go well eventually.I went back to marketing after and believe one day I'll be building a digital product again</p>

						<h1>Why am I applying to Founder and Coder?</h1>
						<p >I'm turning 30 this year and I think it's time to really dive into something I am passionate in (in stead of working in a 9-to-5 which I don't really enjoy :( . I know some basic coding skills but I'm not a profession - at least not to the extent I can code and build web/mobile product from sctract, and i have limited knowledge in javascript - which i think it's a language I must acquire.</p>

						<p>My resoluton of the year is to resume my training in coding & programming,and to build a sustanable web-based product in this or next year.I believe Founder and Coder is the best place for me to train up my coding skills and conneting with like minded people:)</p>
